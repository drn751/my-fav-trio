    			<h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
    			<ul>
			      	<li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
			        	University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known as the
			        	"National Youth Administration"
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works
			   		    in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw
			        	how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US
			        	Forestry Service
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets
				        laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he
				        returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
			    	    pest-resistent plants.
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl
			        	Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to
				        work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and
			        	other applied science.
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
			        	leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
			        	pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
			        	different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
			        	varieties for each major climate on Earth.
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
			        	season, doubling wheat yields
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
			        	with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
				        well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding
			        	strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate
			        	mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
			      	</li>
			      	<li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically
			        	increase their maize and sorghum yields
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M
			        	University
			      	</li>
			      	<li>
			        	<strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food
			        	supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way
			        	we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
			        	are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying
			        	plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science,
			    	    people were selecting the best breeds."
			      	</li>
			      	<li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
